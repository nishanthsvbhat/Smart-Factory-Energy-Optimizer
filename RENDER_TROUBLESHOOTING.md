# Render Deployment Troubleshooting

## Issue: Build failing with "Exited with status 1"

### Potential Causes:
1. Python version incompatibility (Render using 3.13.4, our app tested on 3.11)
2. Package dependency conflicts
3. Missing model file during build
4. Path issues with backend directory

### Solutions to try:

## Solution 1: Pin Python Version
Create runtime.txt with specific Python version

## Solution 2: Simplified Build Process  
Remove model creation from build, use pre-built model

## Solution 3: Fix Package Versions
Use more compatible package versions

## Solution 4: Alternative Deployment
Use simpler deployment method
