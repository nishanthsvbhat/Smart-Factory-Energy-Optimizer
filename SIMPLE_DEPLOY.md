# Simple Render Deployment Instructions

## The Issue
Render is having trouble with the complex build process. Let's use the simplest possible approach.

## Current Status
- ✅ Model file (energy_predictor.pkl) is already in the repository
- ✅ All code is working locally
- ❌ Render build is failing

## Simple Solution
Use minimal configuration to deploy just the essential FastAPI app.

## Backup Files Created
- requirements.txt (simplified versions)
- runtime.txt (Python 3.11.0)
- Simplified render.yaml
